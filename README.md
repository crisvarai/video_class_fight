# video_class_fight

The detection of a violent event in surveillance systems is becoming increasingly important in the development of smart cities and their role in security. The effectiveness of violent event detectors is measured by response speed and accuracy and generality over different types of video sources with a different format.

Videos inherently embody static and dynamic information that is encoded in frames. The main goal of this project is to build a binary classifier capable of correctly predicting whether or not there is a fight in a video.
